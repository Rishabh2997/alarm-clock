# alarm-clock

This project is an alarm based on a clock. Alarms can be set for any desired time. The most crucial aspect of this project is that it utilizes the local storage provided by your browser, thus if you unintentionally close a tab or the entire browser window,

Your configured alarm is still on the window. The page is still there when you return to it.

 Additionally, it recalls the time that you last set the alarm.
